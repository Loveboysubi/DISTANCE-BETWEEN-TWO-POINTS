# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program
### Step 2: 
get the input value as|1,|2
### Step 3:
substitute the values in the distance formula
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the required output
### Step 5: program
end of the

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```


### OUTPUT:
